# Treasure-hunt-adventure
This project successfully combines data structures with Java GUI to create a  playable and interactive two-level board game. It demonstrates proficiency in linked lists, binary  trees, file handling, and event-driven programming using Swing. It also provides modularity by  separating game logic and data handling across diAerent classes.
